# Distribution-Free Joint Independence Testing and Robust Independent Component Analysis Using Optimal Transport

This repository reproduces the results reported in the paper.


# Get started

First, clone the `RJdCov-project` repository onto your machine. Then enter the `RJdCov-project.Rproj`. One needs to first restore the necessary R packages using the following R code.

```         
library(renv)
renv::restore()
```

# Reproduce the results and figures for simulation and real data analysis

The following commands require to be executed in terminal; or you can use `source()` to execute individual R script. The corresponding figure index is indicated in the comment lines of the code.

## Run the simulation for comparing different tests and create figures

One can use the following command to reproduce the simulation results for Type-I error and power comparison of different tests. 

``` 
Rscript run_testing_simulation.R
```

## Run the ICA simulation and create figures

One can use the following command to reproduce the ICA simulation results. 

``` 
Rscript run_ICA.R
```

## Run the dependence set recovery simulation and create figures

One can use the following command to reproduce the simulation results for dependence set recovery. 

``` 
Rscript run_dependence_recovery.R
```


## Run the real data analysis and create figures

One can use the following command to reproduce the real data analysis results. 

``` 
Rscript run_real_data.R
```
